- 👋 Hi, I’m @MubarakAliM
- 👀 I’m interested in in the design of silicon photonics and working on reconfigurable electronic-photonic integerated circuits(RePIC) architecture aiming for high-performance computing applications such as quantum computing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning he PDK based silicon componenent simulation and optimization methods including fabrication nonlinearities.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the design of reconfigurable silicon photonic component and circuits.
